Manusys 15
As the signature  event of the Association of Manufacturing  Engineers, Manusys  marks the  confluence  of students belonging  to various disciplines. It is the annual symposium comprising of three grand days of events, exhibitions, workshops,guest  lectures, paper presentations and several other interesting slots in the agenda that provide a unique platform for students to exhibit their talent and creativity.

The Department of Manufacturing Engineering was born out of an idea to provide  a  unique  course combining the key  aspects  of  core  production engineering coupled with advanced manufacturing engineering, modern management  and  decision making sciences. Striving towards contributing to the endless  field  of  manufacturing that  seems  to  rule  this  phase of human existence, DoME aims to  nurture  the skills required for such  a  vision  in  its  students.
